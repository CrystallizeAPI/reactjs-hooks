# React JS Hooks

This is the **JS API Client** wrapper for React JS using hooks.

It provides Hooks and a Provider to handle a Crystallize State.

## Installation

With NPM

```bash
npm install @crystallize/reactjs-hooks
```

With Yarn

```bash
yarn add @crystallize/reactjs-hooks
```

## Usage

```javascript
import { CrystallizeProvider } from '@crystallize/reactjs-hooks';
ReactDOM.render(
    <CrystallizeProvider language="en" tenantIdentifier="furniture">
        <App />
    </CrystallizeProvider>,
    document.getElementById('root'),
);
```

And then anywhere in the component tree:

```javascript
import { useCrystallize } from '@crystallize/reactjs-hooks';
const { state, dispatch, apiClient, helpers } = useCrystallize();

// Component A

useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
        const caller = apiClient.catalogueApi;
        const query = `query ($language: String!, $path: String!) {
                    catalogue(language: $language, path: $path) {
                        ... on Product {
                        name
                        }
                    }
                }`;
        const response = await caller(query, {
            language: 'en',
            path: '/shop/chairs/bamboo-chair',
        });

        console.log(response.data.catalogue.name);
    })();
}, []);
```

As you can see, you get direct access to a built **apiClient**. You also get access to a helpers object that wraps the following constructors from the JS API Client:

-   catalogueFetcher
-   navigationFetcher
-   productHydrater
-   orderFetcher

But on those, in the React JS Context you donâ€™t have to provide the language, because the context knows it.

The State holds the configuration and the language, and the Dispatch exposes:

-   loading: (state: boolean)
-   changeLanguage: (language: string)
-   updateConfiguration: (configuration: ClientConfiguration)
